Option 2 -¬†¬†3 day workshop, each day for 3 hours.¬† ¬†

Course topics¬†
1. Course on Fundamentals Data Analytics¬†
2. Course on Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

After attending the workshop, the students have to build and showcase their completed projects at a national level. The participating students will spend weeks collaborating and be engaged in the challenge through the series of bootcamps and webinars. These activities would successfully enable the students to transform their ideas from paper to prototypes.¬†

22/09/2022, 08:33 - Arun_Ghandat Jspm Sir CC: *IMPORTANCE OF SEMINARS, WORKSHOPS AND PRESENTATIONS IN STUDENTS LIFE*

Seminars and workshops¬†play a very important role in every student‚Äôs life.¬†Importance of seminars, workshops and presentations for students¬†is immense as they help students analyze, be updated on latest trends, understand concepts and expand their network.
Why seminars are important for students?¬†The¬†importance of seminars ,workshops and presentations¬†has been identified by the schools and colleges as it deals with the development strategies.
Seminars are organized for a day or a couple of days, with the aim of bringing together subject experts and industry professionals to share expertise and ideas. Seminars help you to improve your knowledge and get updated to the latest technological developments.¬†Why workshops are important for students?¬†Assuring a smooth flow of information, seminars and workshops encourage passionate dialogue and active engagement, enhancing students‚Äô skills and knowledge.
Seminars¬†improve the confidence¬†among the individual. Students do a lot of research work to gather information and in the process read and get to understand concepts. ¬†Students are updated with the knowledge and at the same time gain confidence about the subject. Seminars will help the students to assess themselves and improve in the areas in which they were lacking. Speaking to the industry experts and professionals will boost confidence and also help them in interviews.
Improve Communication Skills-¬†There are many students who have the knowledge but do not get a platform. Seminars and workshops fill this gap and also provide them the much needed arena to showcase talent. Whilst doing all this, it boosts their confidence and communication skills.¬†
Improves Networking-¬†Workshops are the very great opportunity for the students to interact with industry professionals and subject experts. Meeting new people will enable us to learn and be updated on technology, corporate culture and happenings in industry.¬†
Learn the Market (Current Conditions)¬†Seminars or Workshops will enable the student to choose the best career of interest. Presentations on certain research topics can help the students to decide for the higher studies. Attending a seminar by industry experts‚Äô students can gain knowledge in work style and adapt to the corporate culture.
Seminars and workshops are the opportunities to¬†the students to learn from different environment than classroom. This benefits the student to learn very effectively and efficiently.

 *VOIS & Vodafone Idea Foundation has developed a go-to app for becoming climate aware
through knowledge and climate action called Our Green Planet* The app aims at building
climate-aware youth and children through its varied knowledge & action resources. The app
gives an opportunity to individuals and organizations to explore developments around the globe
towards climate change action. It is aimed at aggregating and co-creating knowledge and
information on environmentally responsive behaviours. Further, it also endeavours to pursue
result-oriented social media campaigns for encouraging people, and specifically the youth, to
take proactive actions in promoting sustainable lifestyles towards a positive impact on the
environmental ecosystem in their surroundings.
Our Green Planet app primarily focuses on environmental sustainability covering three major
aspects: Low carbon initiatives, Renewable energy usage and E-waste management. It has a
resolute emphasis on the environment/climate change-induced vulnerability of marginal
communities and pragmatic steps for building resilience.
The mobile application is equipped with diverse tools that help us in getting a deeper
understanding of the aforementioned themes and motivates users to employ positive changes
that can help in boosting climate action targets. The main features of the mobile applications are
listed below:

‚úÖ *Calculate My Carbon (CMC) tool* that allows you to calculate your carbon footprint and

How to participate in the training and internship?

 

    Students will have to answer a scholarship test to qualify to participate. To answer the scholarship, students have to visit https://info.boltiot.com/pythonprogrammingscholarship
    Our team of developers will train the qualifying students on the concepts of Python programming via online video training, followed by an internship opportunity. The qualifying students will get an 80% discount on the training.
    Post the training, the students have to build a project in Python Programming as per the problem statement by Decathlon. All students who submit the working project will be issued an internship certificate by Decathlon.
    The top-performing students will get an opportunity for an in-office internship with Decathlon with an excellent stipend. The internship can also be converted into a full-time job offer based on performance.

 


For any queries, you could reply to this E-Mail or call (+91)8881197198 and dial 4 to connect to me. We hope to have excellent participation from your college in the internship.

24/04/2023, 10:49 - Sayali Shrivakar Jspm Ma'am Tpo: Dear Students,

We are excited to bring a brand-new feature to Coffeee Platform ‚Äì ‚ÄúPractice and Grow‚Äù

Practice & Grow allows you to challenge yourself by practicing your skills and becoming a better coder with each passing day. It involves solving coding problems across different difficulty levels, that test your competency in a particular skill set.



Click on this link to get started: https://www.coffeee.io/practice



Currently, you can practice your skills in C, C++, Java, Python, Go, and JavaScript



Details about Practice and Grow:

Practice & Grow will help you demonstrate your coding skills and secure a high rank on Coffeee's Global Leader board. This will significantly increase your chances of getting hired by top companies.
There are a total of 10 levels consisting of 10 questions each. After you solve any 5 questions in a particular level, the next level gets unlocked.
You will be awarded Coffeee Belts on passing each level (same as Martial Arts). There are a total of 10 belts for each skill set that you can earn by clearing different levels (from White Belt to Black Belt).
Coffeee Beans are a reward currency that you earn for completing specific activities such as solving a question, passing a level, etc. Soon, you will be able to redeem Coffeee Beans for exciting prizes!
You can earn Coffeee beans by solving as many questions as you can and clearing different levels.
Solving a question = 100 Coffeee beans earned
Clearing a level = 500 Coffeee beans earned
Clearing all 10 Levels = 2000 Coffeee beans earned
The leaderboard is sorted by the number of Coffeee Beans earned. More the Coffeee Beans you have, the higher your rank. You need to solve questions, clear levels and win a Black belt in different skill sets to earn Coffeee beans.
You can practice as many skills as you want.
Soon, we will have exciting daily, weekly, and monthly prizes for community members ranking high on the leaderboard.

Step 1: Group Discussion -Ground rules for GD:

1.    Respect: Participants should respect one another's opinions and avoid making personal attacks or derogatory comments.

2.    Active Listening: Participants should actively listen to one another and avoid interrupting or talking over each other.

3.    One Speaker at a Time: Participants should take turns speaking and avoid speaking out of turn or dominating the conversation.

4.    Confidentiality: Participants should respect the confidentiality of any personal information that is shared during the discussion.

5.    Stay on Topic: Participants should stay focused on the topic at hand and avoid discussing unrelated issues.

6.    Constructive Criticism: Participants should offer constructive criticism and feedback rather than criticism that is hurtful or unproductive.

7.    Open-Mindedness: Participants should approach the discussion with an open mind and be willing to consider new ideas and perspectives.

8.    And overall, the most important point is the approach to communication‚Äîthe way the students are using the approach to communication with each other.

 

Topics of GD will be given on the spot

 Step 2. Selected students from group discussions will be taken further for an HR interaction or interview.
